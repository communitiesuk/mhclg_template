# Hackney Council Digital Template

This provides a template containing the Hackney Council header and footer, and associated assets. It aims to provide a consistent Hackney Council brand experience across `www.hackney.gov.uk`.

The template is built from [`source`](source/) files, and multiple packages are generated to support different languages and frameworks.

Packages for RubyGems, NPM, ejs, jinja, and other templating languages are available [here](https://github.com/unboxed/hackney_template/pkg).
